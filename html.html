    <h2>Why Task Grab is the Perfect Solution for Your Team</h2>

    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Color-Coded Point System (Easy and Clear)</h3>
        <p>Tasks are color-coded based on difficulty, so your team always knows what they’re getting into:</p>
        <div class="point-system">
            <div class="point green">
                <h4>Green (5 points)</h4>
                <p>Simple tasks that anyone can handle.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="point yellow">
                <h4>Yellow (10 points)</h4>
                <p>Medium-difficulty tasks that require a bit more effort.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="point red">
                <h4>Red (15 points)</h4>
                <p>Hard tasks for your most experienced team members.</p>

        <h3>Task Tracking Made Easy (Stay on Top of Progress)</h3>
        <p>Tasks move through three simple stages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Available:</strong> Tasks ready to be grabbed.</li>
            <li><strong>Taken:</strong> Once a team member grabs a task, it’s locked in their hands.</li>
            <li><strong>Complete:</strong> Once finished, tasks are grayed out, marking them as done!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This ensures that no task gets lost in the shuffle, and you always know where everything stands.</p>
